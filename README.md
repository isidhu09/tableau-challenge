## Analysis
The focus of this study is to help locate areas where the City Bike could potentially benefit from revenue management tactics. 
* Reviewed metrics on most active months, preferences on day of week (DOW), membership by month and DOW, and finally bike type preferences. 
  * There was an increase of over 100% in average counts when comparing Q1 to Q2 ridership. The most noticeable shift (+50%) occurred from Feb to Mar. There seems to be a direct correlation between seasonality and ridership. City Bike should attempt to increase rates from Feb - Mar and then again for the Summer starting May.
  * There is a noticeable shift in busy times by day of week. Weekdays are busiest during the morning/evening hours between 6-9am and 5-7pm. Whereas weekend volume tends to be heavier between 10am-4pm. If City Bike decides to branch from a membership model - this gives an opportunity to introduce surge pricing. 
  * Looking further into DOW trends for the month of June 2022 - There are noticeable spikes and dips for member usages. Member usage spikes during the weekdays, whereas casual customers spike on the weekends - getting up to about 30% of total usages. This is an area where they can increase marketing to convert casual users to member to improve their reach on promotions and special offers.
  * Seasonality also has a direct impact on the type of bike usage. Electric bikes are preferred during the colder months. City Bike should adjust rates to reflect the cost per type by seasonality. There is noticeable opportunity for City Bike to adjust rates during peak and trough periods by DOW and Seasonality.
